# üå©Ô∏è CloudXL ‚Äî One Cloud to Rule Them All  

CloudXL is a full-stack enterprise storage platform that lets you escape the limits of "just 15 GB" by pooling together multiple free cloud storage accounts (Google Drive, Dropbox).

When you upload a file, CloudXL automatically splits it into chunks and distributes those parts across your linked cloud accounts. On download, it seamlessly pulls the pieces back together ‚Äî like magic. ‚ú®

Now with **Team Collaboration** ‚Äî create teams, invite members, manage role-based access, and share files across different team profiles (editors, content-writers, tech-devs). Perfect for distributed teams managing content and projects!

A **super-cloud** powered by all your free space. üöÄ
